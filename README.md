### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub!

⚙️As a Mechanical Engineering Master's graduate from NOVA School of Science and Technology, I dove into the intricacies of aortic hemodynamics, exploring the impacts of endovascular prosthetics on blood flow dynamics.

👩‍💻 Transitioning from engineering to the tech world, I've embraced the role of a Custom Software Engineering Analyst at Accenture. Here, I've honed my coordination and implementation skills across diverse projects, sparking a profound interest in the art of coding and software development.

📚With a relentless drive to merge analytical engineering approaches with creative software solutions, I'm currently expanding my repertoire as a Full Stack Developer student at Codemaster (boot camp). I'm actively sharpening my abilities in:

    - Frontend essentials: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript
    - Backend technologies: PHP, SQL, and Java
    - Development tools: Git, GitHub
   
I'm passionate about creating efficient, scalable solutions that bridge the gap between technical performance and real-world applications.
